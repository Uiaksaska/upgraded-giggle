<!--for tip preparation, presumably resulting in the tip apex being covered with gold. Part of the data was measured with a CO-functionalized tip apex. To this end, a sub-monolayer coverage of NaCl was also deposited on the whole surface at a sample temperature of approximately 35 °C, to grow two monolayer NaCl islands also on the half of the sample used for tip preparation. After preparing a tip by indenting into the remaining gold surface, a CO molecule was picked up from the two monolayer NaCl islands, after which the tip was transferred to the thick NaCl film35. The NaCl film inhibits any electrons to tunnel to or from the gold structure. The voltage that is applied to the gold structure with respect to the tip represents a gate voltage (VG), gating the molecular electronic states against the chemical potential of the conductive tip. The measured molecules (pentacene-h14 and PTCDA-h8, Sigma-Aldrich; pentacene-d14, Toronto Research Chemicals) and CO for tip functionalization were deposited in situ onto the sample inside the scan head at a temperature of approximately 8 K. Pentacene was reported to adsorb centred above a Cl− anion with the long molecular axis aligned with the polar direction of NaCl, resulting in two equivalent azimuthal orientations36.for tip preparation, presumably resulting in the tip apex being covered with gold.
